# Grav image slideshow theme

Takes all the images from a page (with template `default`) and display them in a slideshow.

You can add photo credit to all of the images in a with the header `credit`. Use [metafiles](http://learn.getgrav.org/content/media#metafiles) to add credit to a specific image (`credit: text`). If both the general credit is set and a metafile is used, the credit from the metafile will be displayed.

The first image will be used as favicon.
